<P>ASP 3.0 is the most recent version of ASP, and is released with version 5.0 
of Microsoft's <B>Internet Information Server</B> (IIS 5.0) web server, with 
<B>Windows 2000</B>. It is also ported for use on UNIX.

<P>ASP is an easy way to control content – giving us the 
flexibility to handle complex professional commercial sites. If you want to 
program a web page, pure HTML is fine, however this book shows how to add 
dynamism to web site generation and will utilize components, objects and 
databases to achieve that.
