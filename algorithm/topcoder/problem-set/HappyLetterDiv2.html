<html><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><p>The Happy Letter game is played as follows:
At the beginning, several players enter the field.
Each player has a lowercase English letter on their back.
The game is played in turns.
In each turn, you select two players with different letters, and both selected players leave the field.
The game ends once it is impossible to take another turn.</p>

<p>If there are some players left in the field at the end of the game, they must all have the same letter.
That letter is called the winning letter.
If there are no players left in the field at the end of the game, there is no winning letter.</p>

<p>In general, there may be many different ways how to play the game, and these may lead to different outcomes of the game.
However, sometimes we can look at the initial players and determine that each possible sequence of turns leads to the same winning letter.
That winning letter is then called a happy letter.</p>

<p>You are given a string <b>letters</b>.
The characters in <b>letters</b> are the characters carried by the players at the beginning of the game.
Return a string with one character: either the happy letter (if it exists), or a period ('.') if there is no happy letter.</p>
